# Understanding JWT (JSON Web Token)

The main purpose of **JWT (JSON Web Token)** is not to replace passwords but to enable **stateless authentication** after the user has logged in.

## üîπ Why Use JWT If We Still Have a Password?

### 1. **Passwords Are Only Used Once for Login**
- When a user logs in, they provide their email/username & password.
- If the credentials are correct, the server generates a **JWT token** and sends it to the client.
- The client stores this token (usually in **localStorage, sessionStorage, or HTTP-only cookies**).
- From this point on, the client **does not send the password** with every request‚Äîonly the JWT.

### 2. **JWT Enables Stateless Authentication**
- Instead of checking the **database for user sessions** every time, the backend just **verifies the JWT**.
- The backend doesn't need to **remember logged-in users**, making authentication **fast and scalable**.

### 3. **JWT Eliminates the Need for a Session Store**
- Traditional authentication methods require maintaining a **session** (e.g., storing a session ID in the database).
- JWTs are **self-contained**, meaning they hold all necessary user information.
- The server doesn‚Äôt need to **keep track of active sessions**‚Äîit simply verifies the token.

## üîπ How JWT Works in a Real System

1Ô∏è‚É£ **User logs in** with email & password ‚Üí Server verifies credentials.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Server generates a JWT** with a secret key ‚Üí Sends it to the client.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ **Client stores the token** and sends it with each request *(e.g., in headers like `Authorization: Bearer <token>`)*.  
4Ô∏è‚É£ **Server verifies the token** on every request and grants access.
