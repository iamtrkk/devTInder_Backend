Great question! The main purpose of JWT (JSON Web Token) is not to replace passwords but to enable stateless authentication after the user has logged in. Let me break it down:

üîπ Why Use JWT If We Still Have a Password?
Passwords Are Only Used Once for Login

When a user logs in, they provide their email/username & password.
If the credentials are correct, the server generates a JWT token and sends it to the client.
The client stores this token (usually in localStorage, sessionStorage, or HTTP-only cookies).
From this point on, the client does not send the password with every request‚Äîonly the JWT.
JWT Enables Stateless Authentication

Instead of checking the database for user sessions every time, the backend just verifies the JWT.
The backend doesn't need to remember logged-in users, making authentication fast and scalable.
JWT Eliminates the Need for a Session Store

Traditional authentication methods require maintaining a session (like storing a session ID in the database).
JWTs are self-contained, meaning they hold all necessary user info.
The server doesn‚Äôt need to keep track of active sessions‚Äîjust verify the token.
üîπ How It Works in a Real System
1Ô∏è‚É£ User logs in with email & password ‚Üí Server verifies credentials
2Ô∏è‚É£ Server generates a JWT with a secret key ‚Üí Sends it to the client
3Ô∏è‚É£ Client stores the token and sends it with each request (in headers like Authorization: Bearer <token>)
4Ô∏è‚É£ Server verifies the token on every request and grants access
