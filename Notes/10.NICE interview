API throttling is a technique used to **limit the number of API requests** a user or client can make within a specific time frame. It's used to:

1. **Prevent server overload**.
2. **Ensure fair usage** among multiple users.
3. **Protect against abuse** or accidental request floods.

### Example:

An API might allow **100 requests per minute per user**. If a user exceeds that, they get a **429 Too Many Requests** response until the limit resets.

Would you like to see how to implement throttling in a Node.js or Spring Boot API?
In Agile (especially in Scrum), **Epics** and **Stories** are both types of work items, but they differ in scope and detail:

### **Epic:**

* A **large body of work** that can be broken down into smaller tasks.
* Represents a **broad goal or feature**.
* Often spans multiple sprints or iterations.
* Example: *"Implement user authentication system"*

### **Story (User Story):**

* A **smaller, actionable piece of work** derived from an epic.
* Describes a **feature or requirement from the end-user perspective**.
* Should be completed within a single sprint.
* Example: *"As a user, I want to reset my password so that I can regain access to my account."*

In short:
**Epic = Big picture**,
**Story = Small, specific requirement** that contributes to the epic.

Would you like an example showing how an epic is broken into multiple stories?

### üîç **Core Difference**

| Feature         | JavaScript (JS)                    | TypeScript (TS)                                |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Type System     | Dynamic (types checked at runtime) | Static (types checked at compile time)         |
| Language Level  | Interpreted scripting language     | Superset of JavaScript with added types        |
| Compilation     | No compilation needed              | Compiles to JavaScript                         |
| Error Detection | Runtime errors                     | Compile-time errors (fewer bugs in production) |

---

### ‚úÖ **Advantages of TypeScript**

1. **Type Safety**
   ‚Üí Catch bugs early at compile time due to strict type checks.

2. **Better IDE Support**
   ‚Üí IntelliSense, autocompletion, and refactoring are more powerful.

Would you like help converting a JavaScript project to TypeScript?

Great question! Staying up to date with frequent changes in JavaScript libraries **can be a challenge**, and yes‚Äîit can be considered a **disadvantage** depending on the project and team structure. Let‚Äôs break it down:

---

### üîÑ **Why JS Libraries Change Frequently**

* Fast-paced innovation in the web ecosystem.
* New features, performance improvements, or security fixes.
* Frameworks evolve quickly (e.g., React, Vue, Angular).
* Open-source contributions lead to rapid iteration.

---

### ‚ùó**Disadvantages of Frequent Changes**

* **Breaking changes** in libraries may require code rewrites.
* **Inconsistent documentation** if you‚Äôre on older versions.
* More time spent on **dependency management**.
* Risk of **technical debt** if updates are ignored too long.

---

### ‚úÖ **Ways to Catch Up With Changes**

1. **Follow Official Blogs / GitHub Repos**

   * Example: [React Blog](https://reactjs.org/blog/), [Vue GitHub](https://github.com/vuejs/vue)
   * Watch release notes and changelogs.

2. **Subscribe to Newsletters**

   * JS Weekly, Frontend Focus, Dev.to updates.

3. **Use Semver (Semantic Versioning) Wisely**

   * In `package.json`, use:

     ```json
     "react": "^18.0.0"  // Accept patch and minor updates
     ```

4. **Stay Active on Developer Forums**

   * Stack Overflow, Reddit, Twitter/X, and Discord communities.

5. **Use Tools like Dependabot or Renovate**

   * They auto-check for outdated dependencies and open PRs.

6. **Set Aside Refactor Time in Sprints**

   * Budget time for upgrades and compatibility checks.

---

### üåê **Role of CDN Links in This Context**

**CDN (Content Delivery Network) links** let you include JavaScript libraries directly in HTML without installing via npm.

#### ‚úÖ Pros:

* Quick to use for prototyping or static sites.
* Always points to the latest (or specific) version of a library.
* Reduces server load by leveraging global edge caching.

#### ‚ùå Cons:

* If you use the **latest version (`latest`)**, it may break unexpectedly due to sudden changes.
* Limited control over dependencies and caching.
* Not ideal for production at scale (npm + bundlers are better).

#### Example:

```html
<!-- Specific version (safer) -->
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/lodash@4.17.21/lodash.min.js"></script>

<!-- Latest version (risky) -->
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/lodash@latest/lodash.min.js"></script>
```

Great question! While most developers are familiar with the common HTTP status codes like **200 (OK)** or **404 (Not Found)**, there are quite a few **less common ones** (like **502**) that can cause unexpected behavior or confusion.

Here‚Äôs a categorized list of **common** and **surprisingly uncommon** (but important) HTTP status codes:

---

### ‚úÖ **Common HTTP Status Codes**

| Code | Name                  | Meaning                                         |
| ---- | --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| 200  | OK                    | Request was successful                          |
| 201  | Created               | Resource successfully created (e.g. after POST) |
| 204  | No Content            | Request successful, but no body returned        |
| 301  | Moved Permanently     | Resource has been permanently moved             |
| 302  | Found / Redirect      | Temporary redirect                              |
| 400  | Bad Request           | Malformed request or validation error           |
| 401  | Unauthorized          | Missing or invalid authentication               |
| 403  | Forbidden             | Authenticated, but no permission                |
| 404  | Not Found             | Resource not found                              |
| 500  | Internal Server Error | Server-side problem                             |

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Uncommon / Easily Overlooked HTTP Status Codes**

| Code    | Name                            | Why It Might Surprise You                                                                         |
| ------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **206** | Partial Content                 | Returned when using range headers (e.g. streaming media)                                          |
| **418** | I'm a teapot ü´ñ                 | Easter egg from RFC 2324 ‚Äì not used seriously, but may appear in mocks                            |
| **429** | Too Many Requests               | You‚Äôve hit a rate limit (often from throttling/misconfigured APIs)                                |
| **451** | Unavailable For Legal Reasons   | Blocked for legal reasons (e.g. censorship or DMCA)                                               |
| **499** | Client Closed Request (Nginx)   | Client disconnected before server responded (not standard, but seen in logs)                      |
| **502** | Bad Gateway                     | Server acting as a gateway got an invalid response ‚Äì often seen with reverse proxies (like Nginx) |
| **503** | Service Unavailable             | Server is overloaded or down for maintenance                                                      |
| **504** | Gateway Timeout                 | Timeout waiting for a response from another service or upstream                                   |
| **507** | Insufficient Storage            | WebDAV status; indicates server is out of space                                                   |
| **511** | Network Authentication Required | Often seen in captive portals (e.g., airport Wi-Fi)                                               |

---

### üß† **Extra Notes on Troublesome Ones**

* **502 Bad Gateway**:
  Happens when a server (like Nginx or Cloudflare) acts as a proxy and receives an invalid response from the backend (like Node.js or Python).

* **429 Too Many Requests**:
  Common with APIs that implement rate limiting (e.g., GitHub, OpenAI).

* **503 Service Unavailable**:
  Can be due to server overload, autoscaling delay, or intentional maintenance mode.

* **504 Gateway Timeout**:
  Indicates a slow or stuck backend service.

---

### üì¶ **Helpful Tip for Developers**

Always **log the full response status + message** during API failures, not just `status === 200` checks. It‚Äôll help you spot these edge-case responses faster.

Would you like a list of how to handle these statuses gracefully in a frontend app (e.g., with Axios or fetch)?

Here‚Äôs a comprehensive comparison between **MongoDB** and **MySQL**, covering structure, use cases, pros/cons, and when to use each:

---

### üîç **High-Level Difference**

| Feature        | **MongoDB**                      | **MySQL**                           |
| -------------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Type           | NoSQL (Document Database)        | SQL (Relational Database)           |
| Data Format    | JSON-like (BSON) documents       | Tables with rows and columns        |
| Schema         | Flexible (schema-less)           | Fixed schema (strictly defined)     |
| Query Language | MongoDB Query Language (MQL)     | Structured Query Language (SQL)     |
| Scalability    | Horizontally scalable (sharding) | Vertically scalable (read replicas) |

---

### üìò **Data Model Example**

#### MongoDB

```json
{
  "name": "Alice",
  "email": "alice@example.com",
  "skills": ["React", "Node.js"]
}
```

#### MySQL

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  id INT,
  name VARCHAR(255),
  email VARCHAR(255)
);

CREATE TABLE skills (
  user_id INT,
  skill VARCHAR(255)
);
```

MongoDB stores data **as one document**, while MySQL uses **normalized tables** and joins.

---

### ‚úÖ **Advantages of MongoDB**

* üöÄ **Flexible Schema** ‚Äì No need to define structure beforehand.
* ‚ö° **Faster for Unstructured/Changing Data** ‚Äì Ideal for agile dev and MVPs.
* üåç **Better for Large Scale + Geo-Distributed Systems** ‚Äì Native sharding.
* üõ†Ô∏è **Great for JSON-heavy or nested data** ‚Äì Like user profiles, logs, content.

---

### ‚úÖ **Advantages of MySQL**

* üîí **Strong ACID Compliance** ‚Äì Great for financial or transactional systems.
* üßÆ **Powerful Querying and Joins** ‚Äì Perfect for normalized data.
* üéØ **Well-established ecosystem** ‚Äì Tools, support, and community.
* üóÉÔ∏è **Better for complex relationships** ‚Äì Referential integrity via foreign keys.

---

### ‚ùó Disadvantages

| MongoDB                            | MySQL                                        |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| No joins (has lookup, but limited) | Schema changes are rigid and painful         |
| May sacrifice consistency (CAP)    | Poor performance with huge unstructured data |
| Requires understanding of sharding | Less flexible schema evolution               |

---

### üõ†Ô∏è **Use Cases**

| Use Case                             | Prefer MongoDB          | Prefer MySQL                |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Social media app (dynamic user data) | ‚úÖ                       | ‚ùå                           |
| Banking / Inventory System           | ‚ùå                       | ‚úÖ                           |
| Real-time analytics or logging       | ‚úÖ                       | ‚ùå                           |
| Complex reporting/dashboarding       | ‚ùå                       | ‚úÖ                           |
| E-commerce product catalog           | ‚úÖ (products vary a lot) | ‚úÖ (if relationships matter) |

---

### üß† Summary

| Area        | MongoDB                         | MySQL                        |
| ----------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Schema      | Dynamic, flexible               | Fixed, structured            |
| Scalability | Horizontal (shards)             | Vertical (replicas, scaling) |
| Speed       | Fast for inserts, flexible data | Fast for complex queries     |

Would you like a real-world example of the same app using MongoDB vs MySQL?

**Event-driven architecture (EDA)** is a software design pattern where **events** (i.e., changes in state or actions) are the core mechanism for communication between different parts of a system.

Instead of one component calling another directly (tight coupling), components **emit events** and **respond to events**. This creates a **loosely coupled**, **scalable**, and often **asynchronous** system.

---

### üîÑ **What is an "Event"?**

An **event** is a message that something has happened.
Examples:

* A user clicks a button ‚Üí `click` event
* A file finishes uploading ‚Üí `uploadComplete` event
* A new order is placed ‚Üí `orderCreated` event

---

### üß† **Core Components of EDA**

| Component                      | Role                                                                                                        |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Event Producer**             | Creates and emits events (e.g., a button click handler)                                                     |
| **Event Consumer**             | Listens for and reacts to events (e.g., executes a callback)                                                |
| **Event Bus / Message Broker** | Routes events to consumers (optional in simple apps, essential in distributed systems like Kafka, RabbitMQ) |

---

### ‚úÖ **Event-Driven in Node.js**

Node.js is **natively event-driven**.
For example:

```js
const EventEmitter = require('events');
const emitter = new EventEmitter();

emitter.on('userLoggedIn', (user) => {
  console.log(`${user.name} has logged in`);
});

emitter.emit('userLoggedIn', { name: 'Alice' });
```

---

### üè¢ **Real-World Example: E-Commerce**

1. **Event**: `orderPlaced`
2. **Producers**:

   * Checkout service
3. **Consumers**:

   * Email service (send receipt)
   * Inventory service (reduce stock)
   * Shipping service (start delivery)

Each service **reacts to the same event**, without knowing about each other.

---

### ‚úÖ **Advantages of EDA**

* üîó **Loosely Coupled** ‚Äì Components don‚Äôt directly depend on each other.
* üîÑ **Asynchronous** ‚Äì Tasks can happen independently and in parallel.
* üì¶ **Scalable** ‚Äì Easy to add more consumers for the same event.
* üîç **Observable** ‚Äì Events can be logged, monitored, replayed.

---

### ‚ùå **Disadvantages**

* üß† **Harder to debug** ‚Äì Events may flow in unpredictable order.
* üìä **Requires good monitoring/logging** ‚Äì To trace what triggered what.
* üìö **Learning curve** ‚Äì Especially in distributed systems.

---

### üì¶ Popular Event-Driven Tools

* **Frontend**: DOM events, Redux (actions), RxJS
* **Backend**: Node.js `EventEmitter`, Kafka, RabbitMQ, Webhooks
* **Cloud**: AWS Lambda with EventBridge, Azure Event Grid, GCP Pub/Sub

### üåÄ `process.nextTick()` in Node.js

`process.nextTick()` is a special function in Node.js that **defers the execution of a callback function until the next iteration (tick) of the event loop**, **before any I/O events or timers are processed**.

---

### üîß **How It Works**

When you call:

```js
process.nextTick(() => {
  console.log('Next tick callback');
});
```

You're telling Node.js:

> "Run this function **right after the current operation finishes**, **before** handling any timers (`setTimeout`), promises, or I/O."

---

### üß† **Execution Order (Simplified)**

Here's the order Node.js follows:

1. **Synchronous code**
2. `process.nextTick()` callbacks (microtask queue)
3. Promises (`Promise.then`, `async/await`) (also microtasks, but after `nextTick`)
4. `setTimeout`, `setImmediate`, `setInterval` (macrotasks)
5. I/O events (like `fs.readFile` callbacks)

---

### üì¶ Example

```js
console.log('Start');

process.nextTick(() => {
  console.log('Next tick');
});

Promise.resolve().then(() => {
  console.log('Promise resolved');
});

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log('setTimeout');
}, 0);

console.log('End');
```

üßæ **Output**:

```
Start
End
Next tick
Promise resolved
setTimeout
```

---

### üöÄ Use Cases

* To defer execution until the current stack clears.
* To ensure code runs *before* any asynchronous I/O or timers.
* Common in libraries and core modules to schedule micro-updates.

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Be Careful

Using `process.nextTick()` **too much or recursively** can **block the event loop**, preventing timers and I/O from executing:

```js
function infiniteLoop() {
  process.nextTick(infiniteLoop); // ‚ö†Ô∏è Will block everything else!
}
infiniteLoop();
```

---

### ‚úÖ Summary

| Feature  | `process.nextTick()`              |
| -------- | --------------------------------- |
| Timing   | Immediately after current op      |
| Priority | Higher than Promises & timers     |
| Used for | Microtask deferral, internals     |
| Caution  | Overuse can starve the event loop |

---

Would you like a visual timeline comparing `nextTick()`, `Promise`, and `setTimeout`?

Great question! `process.nextTick()` and `setImmediate()` are both used to defer execution in Node.js, but they differ in **timing and behavior in the event loop**.

Let‚Äôs break it down:

---

### üÜö **`process.nextTick()` vs `setImmediate()`**

| Feature             | `process.nextTick()`                           | `setImmediate()`                                |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Runs **after**      | The **current operation** (before I/O, timers) | The **current poll phase** of the event loop    |
| Executes **before** | Promises, `setTimeout`, `setImmediate`         | `setTimeout`, after I/O callbacks               |
| Use Case            | Quick microtask, critical callbacks            | Execute **after I/O**, let other ops settle     |
| Queue Type          | **Microtask queue** (higher priority)          | **Check phase** (macrotask queue)               |
| Blocking Risk       | ‚úÖ Can block the event loop if misused          | ‚ùå Safer for deferring without starving the loop |
| Available In        | Node.js only                                   | Node.js only                                    |

### üì¶ Code Example

```js
console.log('Start');

setImmediate(() => {
  console.log('setImmediate');
});

process.nextTick(() => {
  console.log('nextTick');
});

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log('setTimeout');
}, 0);

console.log('End');
```

üßæ **Output**:

```
Start
End
nextTick
setTimeout
setImmediate
```

### üõë `clearImmediate()`

This is used to **cancel** a `setImmediate()`:

```js
const immediateId = setImmediate(() => {
  console.log('Will not run');
});

clearImmediate(immediateId); // Prevents the callback from running
```

There is **no equivalent for `process.nextTick()`**‚Äîonce scheduled, it **cannot be cancelled**.

### üîÑ In Summary

| Concept              | Description                                                 |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `process.nextTick()` | Highest priority microtask ‚Äì runs ASAP, after current stack |
| `setImmediate()`     | Runs on the next full event loop iteration, after I/O       |
| `clearImmediate()`   | Cancels a scheduled `setImmediate()`                        |

---

### üß† Rule of Thumb

* Use `process.nextTick()` for **urgent tasks** that must run immediately after current code.
* Use `setImmediate()` to **defer until after I/O** or let the event loop breathe.
* Avoid stacking too many `nextTick()` calls ‚Äî it can **starve I/O** and timers.

### üòñ What is Callback Hell?

**Callback Hell** is a situation in JavaScript where you have **deeply nested callbacks**, making code:

* Hard to read
* Difficult to maintain
* Prone to bugs

It usually happens when you're doing **many asynchronous operations** that depend on each other.

---

### üï≥Ô∏è Example of Callback Hell

```js
doSomething((err, result1) => {
  if (err) return handleError(err);

  doSomethingElse(result1, (err, result2) => {
    if (err) return handleError(err);

    doAnotherThing(result2, (err, result3) => {
      if (err) return handleError(err);

      finish(result3, (err, finalResult) => {
        if (err) return handleError(err);

        console.log('Done:', finalResult);
      });
    });
  });
});
```

üß® Problems:

* Pyramid structure (often called the ‚Äú**pyramid of doom**‚Äù)
* Hard to track flow
* Error handling repeats
* Doesn‚Äôt scale well

---

### ‚úÖ How to Fix Callback Hell

#### 1. **Use Promises**

```js
doSomething()
  .then(result1 => doSomethingElse(result1))
  .then(result2 => doAnotherThing(result2))
  .then(result3 => finish(result3))
  .then(finalResult => console.log('Done:', finalResult))
  .catch(handleError);
```

#### 2. **Use `async/await`**

```js
async function main() {
  try {
    const result1 = await doSomething();
    const result2 = await doSomethingElse(result1);
    const result3 = await doAnotherThing(result2);
    const finalResult = await finish(result3);
    console.log('Done:', finalResult);
  } catch (err) {
    handleError(err);
  }
}
main();
```

| Concept       | Description                                                 |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Callback Hell | Too many nested callbacks                                   |
| Problem       | Hard to read, maintain, debug                               |
| Solution      | Use **Promises**, **`async/await`**, or **named functions** |
