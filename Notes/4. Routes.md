## `app.use()` in Express.js

In Express.js, `app.use()` is a method used to mount middleware in your application.
Middleware functions process requests before they reach the route handlers. They have access to the request (`req`), response (`res`), and the `next` function, which passes control to the next middleware in the stack.

### Key Points about `app.use()`

1. **Middleware Mounting**:

   - `app.use()` is used to tell Express to use specific middleware for handling requests to your server.

2. **Path Parameter**:

   - It can accept a path as its first argument, meaning the middleware will only be used for requests that match the given path.

3. **Global Middleware**:

   - If no path is provided, the middleware will be applied to all incoming requests.

4. **Order of Execution**:
   - Express executes middleware in the order in which they are defined, so the sequence of `app.use()` calls is important.

### Important Notes

- `app.use()` matches requests irrespective of the HTTP method.
- The **home path (`/trk`) should be defined at the bottom**, otherwise, it will match all routes that start with `/trk`, including `/trk/create`.

**Example:**

```
/trk/create
/trk    // This should be at the end, otherwise it will be returned on /trk/create
```

## Route Patterns in Express.js

Express.js allows for flexible route matching using patterns:

- **`/ab?c`** → The character `b` is optional. Matches `/bc` and `/abc`.
- **`/ab+c`** → The character `b` can be repeated multiple times. Matches `/abbbbbbbbc`.
- **`/a*c`** → The `*` can be replaced with anything. Matches `/atrkc`.
- **Regex in URLs** → You can use regular expressions for advanced pattern matching in routes.
