# Node.js Notes

## Global Object

In JavaScript, the global object is `window`, which can also be accessed using `this`. Both are provided by browsers.

In Node.js, the global object is `global`, which provides functions like `setTimeout`, `setInterval`, etc.

Additionally, `globalThis` is available across all browsers and in Node.js, representing the same object.

```javascript
((window === this) === global) === globalThis; // True
```

## Module System in Node.js

In Node.js, `require` and `module.exports` are part of its module system, which allows developers to organize code into reusable, separate files or packages.

---

### 1. `require`

The `require` function is used to import modules, libraries, or specific code from other files into the current file. It allows you to access the functionality or data exported by another file.

#### Syntax:

```javascript
const moduleName = require("./path/to/module");
```

---

### 2. `module.exports`

The `module.exports` object is used to **export data, functions, or objects** from a module so that other files can access them using `require`.

#### How it Works:

- By default, every file in Node.js is treated as a module.
- Node.js wraps the code of each module in a function, and an empty `module.exports` object is available to add exports.
- You populate `module.exports` with whatever you want to expose.

#### Syntax:

```javascript
module.exports = <value>;
```

Example:

```javascript
module.exports = { add, subtract }; // Export multiple items
```

### Why Use `module.exports`?

The `require` function executes the file like an **IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression)**. However, variables inside a file are private due to lexical scoping. Since each module is wrapped in a function, its variables are not accessible unless explicitly exported using `module.exports`.

## Using `require(fileName)` Without Assigning to a Variable

When you call `require(fileName)` in Node.js **without assigning it to a variable**, the module is still loaded and executed, but its exports are not stored or used in the current file. This is typically used when you want to **execute the module for its side effects** rather than using its exports.

### What Happens When You Call `require(fileName)` Without a Variable:

1. **The module is still loaded and executed:**

   - Node.js reads and runs the code in the module.
   - If the module performs operations (e.g., logging, setting up a server, etc.), those actions will occur.

2. **The module's exports are ignored:**
   - Since you don’t store the result of `require`, you won’t have access to the module's exported values or functions.

---

### Example:

#### File: `logger.js`

```javascript
console.log("Logger module loaded!");

module.exports = {
  log: (message) => console.log(message),
};
```

#### File: `app.js`

```javascript
require("./logger"); // Only executes the file. Exports are ignored.
```

**Output:**

```
Logger module loaded!
```

The code in `logger.js` runs, but you cannot use `logger.log` because you didn’t assign the result of `require('./logger')` to a variable.

---

### Use Cases for Using `require` Without Assigning:

1. **Run Code for Side Effects:**

   - Load a module just to execute its initialization logic or set up some global functionality.

   ```javascript
   require("./setupGlobals"); // Sets up global variables or config
   ```

2. **Run Polyfills:**

   - Some modules modify the global environment, so you don’t need to store their exports.

   ```javascript
   require("dotenv").config(); // Loads environment variables
   ```

3. **Execute Middleware or Framework Hooks:**

   ```javascript
   require("./databaseConnection"); // Automatically connects to the database
   ```

---

## What Happens If the Module is Required Multiple Times?

- Node.js **caches the result** of the first `require` for each module.
- If you require the same module again (with or without assigning it), Node.js will **reuse the cached version** and won’t re-execute the module code unless the cache is cleared.

---

## When Should You Avoid Doing This?

- If you need to use the module's exports, **you must assign it to a variable**.
- Example:

```javascript
const logger = require("./logger");
logger.log("This works!"); // Correct usage
```
